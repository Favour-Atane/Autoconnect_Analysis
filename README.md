# IMOTO.NG_Analysis
IMOTO.NG is a web application designed to bridge the gap between car owners and auto mechanics. A survey was conducted to understand the needs of both mechanics and car owners in order to refine the application’s features and ensure its relevance. The survey received responses from 46 mechanics and 96 car owners.

The IMOTO.NG app was a capstone project completed by seven women in the Women Techsters program. It was an interdisciplinary project involving mobile developers, UI/UX designers, data scientists, product managers, and full-stack developers. The survey was conducted both online and in person, with the data being cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Given the qualitative nature of much of the data, further analysis and visualization were carried out using Power BI.

Survey Overview:
The analysis was segmented between auto mechanics and car owners, with questions tailored to each group. Key questions included:

What brand of car do you own or repair?
What challenges do you face with your car or in your work as a mechanic?
How common is your car type or specialization in your area?
Are you open to using an app to connect with mechanics or car owners?
What are your views on car insurance?
What difficulties do you encounter when sourcing spare parts?
Would you pay for increased visibility through the app?

Summary of Findings:
The survey results confirmed a strong demand for the IMOTO.NG app. Here’s a summary of the insights gathered:

Mechanics:
The survey involved 46 mechanics from eight different locations, with Lagos being the most represented.
Of the respondents, 22 had over 10 years of experience in the industry.
A majority of mechanics (40) specialized in Japanese car brands, while others worked with American cars or diesel trucks, with some handling multiple brands.

Many mechanics were either registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission of Nigeria or had professional certifications, demonstrating their credibility.
While most mechanics did not handle towing services directly, they often recommended towing companies to their customers.
There was limited understanding of how insurance handles payments, though some mechanics mentioned insurance policies covering costs.
Regarding payment options for the app, mechanics preferred paying a commission per customer referral.

Car Owners:
A total of 98 car owners participated in the survey, representing 28 different car brands. Toyota was the most common, with 30 owners reporting it as their primary vehicle.
The participants hailed from 21 locations, with Nigeria being the most common, particularly Lagos.

The most frequent challenges faced by car owners included finding reliable auto technicians, high maintenance costs, and sourcing the right spare parts. The most common issue was the difficulty in finding trustworthy and skilled mechanics.
Most respondents had never used an online platform to connect with mechanics, citing reasons such as lack of awareness, no perceived need, or their mechanic’s unfamiliarity with such platforms.
When asked if they would be willing to use an app to connect with mechanics based on location, the overwhelming majority responded positively. For those who were hesitant, the introduction of a rating system for mechanics positively influenced their willingness to try the app.

Key Insights:
The analysis of the survey provided valuable insights into the needs and pain points of both car owners and mechanics. For mechanics, there was a clear preference for referral-based payments and a need for better understanding of insurance processes. For car owners, the primary concerns revolved around finding trustworthy, skilled mechanics and navigating the high costs of car maintenance.

The insights gathered from this survey directly informed the development of the IMOTO.NG app, ensuring it addressed the real needs of users. By understanding the challenges faced by both mechanics and car owners, the app is better positioned to offer solutions that improve service delivery, increase connectivity, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction.
